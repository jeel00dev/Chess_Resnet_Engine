# Neural Chess Engine Using ResNet

A deep learning-based chess engine that evaluates board positions and predicts moves using a **ResNet-based neural network**.

## Features

- **Position Evaluation**: Predicts the strength of a position using Stockfish-evaluated datasets.
- **Move Prediction**: Suggests optimal moves based on the trained ResNet model.
- **FEN Support**: Works with Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation (FEN) for representing chess positions.
- **Customizable Training**: Train your model on your own chess dataset.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- pandas
- chess (Python library)
- Stockfish (for data labeling)
